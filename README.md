# Bookings ðŸ—“
Web application made as a university project, it allows to make reservations in different comercial places (without date or hour). The main goal was to implement HTML and Javascript, it doesn't connect with a DB so any data that the user enters will be saved in memory and lost at refresh.

The application is currently deployed at Vercel, you can acces it here: [Bookings Web App](https://agustinmartinez-bookings.vercel.app/)

## Manual
In order to try the app you have to understand what you can do with it. There are two kinds of user (Local, Person), each has access to different functionalities which are the following:
### Local
* Modify availability
* Modify booking state
* Modify maximum capacity
* Visualize statistics

### Person
* Register
* Request a booking
* Cancel a booking
* Rate a booking
* Pending bookings
* Visualize statistics

### Pre-Loaded Data

To access as a Local you can use the following credentials (user-pass):
* local1-Local1
* local2-Local2
* local3-Local3
* local4-Local4
* local5-Local5
* local6-Local6
* local7-Local7

These are all the pre-loaded locals.

To acces as a Person you can sign up using the "Registrarse" button, keep in mind that the password must have at least 6 characters and include lower case, upper case and a number.
